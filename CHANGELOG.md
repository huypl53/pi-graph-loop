Notable changes in this project. Newest first.

## Unreleased

### feat(swarm): task graph MVP (create/status/validate/print/next)

- Added the first task-graph layer to `.pi/extensions/swarm/index.ts` with task state/types, atomic `task.json` writes, and `.pi/swarm/tasks/<task-id>/` runtime layout.
- Added swarm tools: `swarm_create_task`, `swarm_task_status`, `swarm_validate_graph`, `swarm_print_graph`, and `swarm_next_nodes`.
- Added backward-compatible structured agent metadata defaults for reuse (`roleKind`, `capabilities`, `activeTaskIds`, `maxConcurrentTasks`) plus internal reusable-agent matching.
- Validated in dedicated tmux UAT lanes with real task creation/printing/validation/status flows; evidence kept under `.pi/swarm-uat/runs/`.

### harden(extensions): `compact-resume` followUp probe + settings.json config

- Added a dedicated validation probe at `scripts/compact_resume_followup_probe.ts` to empirically confirm that a `turn_end` hook can queue `pi.sendMessage(..., { deliverAs: "followUp" })` and have pi's continuation loop drain it without user input.
- Hardened `.pi/extensions/compact-resume.ts` config loading so env vars still win, but project-local `.pi/settings.json` can now override `enabled`, `manual`, and `max` under `extensions["compact-resume"]` (or top-level `compactResume`).
- Kept default-on behavior intentionally; the extension exists to close a project-wide usability gap, while `.pi/settings.json` now provides a no-code project override.

### feat(extensions): `compact-resume` — auto-continue the task after compaction

- **Problem:** pi goes idle after an ordinary auto-compaction (`reason:
  "threshold"`) or a manual `/compact` (`reason: "manual"`), because both set
  `willRetry: false`. Only `reason: "overflow"` (a hard context-overflow error
  caught mid-run) auto-retries. So after a normal compact the agent stops and
  you have to type "continue" yourself, even when it was mid-task.
- **Fix:** new project-local extension `.pi/extensions/compact-resume.ts`. It
  hooks the `session_compact` event and injects one `[compact-resume]` message
  that tells the agent to resume in-progress work (or confirm completion).
  Delivery branches on `ctx.isIdle()`: a `followUp` (fed into pi's existing
  continuation loop) during a run, or `triggerTurn: true` when idle.
- **Loop safety:** skips `overflow` (already retries); smart guard stops once a
  resume turn does no tool work; hard cap of consecutive auto-resumes since the
  last real user message (default 5).
- **Config (env):** `PI_COMPACT_RESUME` (0 disables), `PI_COMPACT_RESUME_MANUAL`
  (1 to also resume after explicit `/compact`), `PI_COMPACT_RESUME_MAX`. Status
  via the `/compact-resume` command.
- **Validated:** end-to-end in an isolated tmux session (pi 0.83.0,
  glm-5.1/zai-coding-cn) — after `/compact` the agent automatically started a
  continuation turn, inspected state, and stopped gracefully. Snapshot kept
  under `tmux-snapshots/compact-resume-validation/` (gitignored).
